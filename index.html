      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a QA engineer who builds reliable, maintainable quality gates. My approach blends clear communication,
        analytical thinking, and a strong product mindset so tests model real user behavior—not just the happy path.
        I care about fast, actionable feedback, readable reports, and zero surprises at release time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My foundation is manual QA across web and mobile: precise test design in Zephyr, focused regression/smoke and exploratory sessions,
        and defect reports with full reproducible steps, impact, and evidence. I validate APIs with Postman and Swagger (auth tokens, response contracts, and data checks)
        and use SQL for end-to-end verification when it adds value.
      </p>
      <p>
        In automation I work primarily with Playwright (JS/TS): modular Page Object patterns, stable semantic selectors, meaningful assertions,
        and a clean test-data strategy. I use API-driven setup where UI adds no value, reduce flakiness with deterministic waits, leverage trace/video for fast debugging,
        and integrate suites into CI to keep quality a first-class part of the delivery pipeline.

      <h2>Experience</h2>

      <h3>Dot Divide - QA Automation Engineer</h3>
      <p><strong>2025 - Present</strong></p>
      <p>
        Building and maintaining Playwright (JS/TS) end-to-end and API coverage with a modular Page Object Model,
        fixtures, and clean test-data strategies. Replacing slow UI steps with API-driven setup where appropriate,
        stabilizing selectors and waits to reduce flakiness, and using trace/video artifacts for fast, reliable debugging.
        Integrating test suites into CI with clear, actionable reporting to keep quality embedded in the delivery pipeline.
      </p>

      <h3>PlayBall - QA Manual & Automation Engineer</h3>
      <p><strong>2023 - 2024</strong></p>
      <p>
    Led API and UI validation for a sports event mobile app (authentication, player statistics, rating flows) with precise Zephyr cases, 
      targeted regression/smoke and exploratory sessions, and clear defect reports. In parallel, initiated the transition to automation using Playwright (JS/TS):
       set up an initial Page Object Model, introduced API-driven login to replace slow UI steps, stabilized selectors with deterministic waits, and automated smoke checks for authentication, stats, and rating flows.
        Collaborated closely with backend/mobile teams to triage issues, reproduce edge cases, and verify fixes.
      </p>

      <h3>Delek Homes - QA Manual Engineer</h3>
      <p><strong>2022 - 2023</strong></p>
      <p>
        Delivered thorough web testing for a real-estate platform: inquiry flows, registration/authentication logic,
        and content display. Wrote and maintained Zephyr test suites, ran weekly regressions to keep filter logic and
        form validations stable, and partnered with product/design to ensure a consistent user experience.

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3>Playwright E2E & API Automation Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Modular POM with reusable fixtures and test-data strategy. API login for faster setup, request
        interception/mocking, deterministic waits, and stable selectors. CI integration with tagging,
        parallel execution, and artifacts (screenshots/trace/video) for quick diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h3>API Collections & Contract Testing</h3>
      <p>
        Postman collections with environments/variables and scripted assertions. Covered auth/token flows,
        status/headers, and response contracts aligned to Swagger/OpenAPI for maintainable, team-friendly API checks.
      </p>

      <h3>Manual QA Test Suites</h3>
      <p>
        Curated regression/smoke and exploratory suites for critical user journeys (auth, forms, filters, notifications).
